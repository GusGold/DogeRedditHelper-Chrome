        <h3>Private Messages</h3>
        <p>
            By default, DogeCoin Reddit Helper scans the page when you load it and highlights as necessary. Please be assured that absolutely nothing is read or sent from here.<br><br>

            If you still feel this compromises your privacy, you can disable it by either right-clicking on the DogeCoin icon in the omnibar (note that this displays only on pages where it will run, e.g. reddit.com/r/dogecoin/* and reddit.com/messages/) and choosing "options". Then uncheck "Allowed in private messages".<br><br>

            Or you can  go to chromes menu (three horizontal bars in the top right), hover over tools, and click on "extensions". Find DogeCoin Reddit Helper in the list, and choose options. Again, uncheck "Allowed in private messages".<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Hiding the Bar</h3>
        <p>
            By default, there is a 30pixel-high bar displayed on relevant pages to give you inline information. If you feel this it intusive, you can disable it by either right-clicking on the DogeCoin icon in the omnibar (note that this displays only on pages where it will run, e.g. reddit.com/r/dogecoin/* and reddit.com/messages/) and choosing "options". Then uncheck "Show Bar".<br><br>

            Or you can  go to chromes menu (three horizontal bars in the top right), hover over tools, and click on "extensions". Find DogeCoin Reddit Helper in the list, and choose options. Again, uncheck "Show Bar".<br><br>

            When it is hidden, the "show/hide" button function as just hide, so once you have finished reading the information, you can select it and the bar will once again be completely hidden.<br><br>

            At any time, even if the bar is hidden, you can still access the same links by left-clicking on the DogeCoin icon and choosing the approiate option.
